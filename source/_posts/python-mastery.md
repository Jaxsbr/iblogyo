## Overview of Python Blog Series

In this series, we will embark on a journey of learning and exploration in various areas of Python programming. As a fellow student on this path, I aim to share my insights and experiences to help you develop a strong foundation in the language. Together, we will dive into the following areas:

- General
- Web Development
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- GUI Development
- Data Visualization
- Game Development
- Automation and Scripting

Additionally, I've compiled a comprehensive list of library references organized according to each area covered in this blog series. You can find the detailed references in my [Reference Guide](https://jaxsbr.github.io/pkb-blog/2023/05/21/python-reference-guide/).

Join me as we navigate through these domains, expand our Python skills, and progress towards mastery. Through practical examples, hands-on projects, and in-depth discussions, we will learn and grow together. Get ready for an exciting adventure into the world of Python!
